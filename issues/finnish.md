# Issues in Finnish

The preposition `with` is used in two different ways, both of which are problematic.

- *X is a country with N inhabitants*  should be with a relative clause ("a country that has N inhabitants")
- *has frontiers with Y to the east, Z to the south,...* reveals an erroneous syntax tree `(AdvNP Y (to D))` which places the postposition *kanssa* in an awkward place. A minor detail is that the preposition should be "in" instead of "to". Thus: *has frontiers Y <kanssa> in the east*.

A non-issue: The pronoun *se* ("it") works well in Finnish for all countries.
